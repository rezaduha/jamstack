  <div class="article__content"><p>You’ve been assigned to create your first training course, and the deadline is approaching quickly. So, what’s next? That’s a bit abrupt beginning sentence for an article, but that’s how it can seem when you get your first e learning content production project. Where do you begin? What kind of final output is needed? What is even possible within the project’s schedule and budget constraints? There are numerous issues to be answered, but one of the most important is, “what type of material will you choose from the various eLearning content types?”</p>
<p>You might ask if there is a perfect roadmap for creating relevant and exciting eLearning content. Still, given the unique circumstances of each project, it’s impossible to cover everything in one strategy.</p>
<p>The following are some of the various factors: <strong>The size of your group, Quantity of content, The topic at hand, The appropriate form of content distribution, The knowledge of the audience Your company’s objectives</strong></p>
<p>Let’s look at the various eLearning content types to decide which ones best suit your eLearning project.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-most-popular-elearning-content-types">What Are the Most Popular eLearning Content Types?</h2>
<h3 id="slide-based-content">Slide-based Content</h3>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyjp4hmcm/image/upload/v1651644840/presentation_slide_g372334986_a99396bb74.png" alt="Presentation slide image"></p>
<p>When most people hear the term eLearning, they immediately think of slide-based courses. They entail the user participating in a self-paced course in which they examine slides with interactive units and the narration and other multimedia features. These courses frequently resemble PowerPoint presentations in appearance and feel.</p>
<p>In a myriad of scenarios, this type of information may be advantageous. Consider using it if you’re looking for a way to:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may already have online learning resources in the form of presentations, documents, PDFs, or other formats that you can quickly convert into an online course.</li>
<li>You need to convert some offline training to an online version quickly.</li>
<li>You want to put onboarding new employees on autopilot.</li>
<li>You need to obtain some fast refresher training on a new product or service.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="quizzes">Quizzes</h3>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyjp4hmcm/image/upload/v1651644625/assessment_online_exam_education_607864_d584a46dce.png" alt="Assessment online exam image"></p>
<p>Quizzes, exams, assessments, or knowledge checks – whatever you choose to call them – are an essential part of nearly any eLearning course. Why? Quizzes help you to keep track of your learners’ knowledge and guarantee that you meet your training’s learning objectives. They’re also a fun and interactive method to break up the content in your training modules and provide a natural breakpoint between important subjects that helps learners feel like they’re progressing through the course.</p>
<h3 id="videos">Videos</h3>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyjp4hmcm/image/upload/v1651644915/zoom_remote_meeting_virtual_686113_31404b4402.png" alt="Zoom remote meeting virtual image"></p>
<p>Video content is now viral, and for a good reason: it’s always more interesting than just text or photographs. You can incorporate video content in your eLearning in a variety of ways:</p>
<p>Videos that can be used in silos: You can only use video as a form of content. You could, for example, make a series of films on a soft skill like conversations during a meeting.</p>
<p>Embedded videos: In your eLearning course, you can include videos. The video could feature original content, public domain footage, or stock footage. This methodology has the advantage of allowing you to use video for specific sections while also incorporating more interactive aspects within the course.</p>
<h3 id="interactive-videos">Interactive Videos</h3>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyjp4hmcm/image/upload/v1651645018/video_template_website_youtube_1606945_baaf733977.png" alt="Video template website image"></p>
<p>Learner apathy or lack of involvement can disadvantage traditional training films, especially in lengthier formats. This is where interactive videos come in handy. We can now deliver video interactions such as hotspots and quizzes thanks to advances in technology. This is the perfect choice when you want to provide consumers the ability to interact with the video’s content by allowing them to click, drag, scroll, hover, gesture, and perform other digital actions.</p>
<p>Samsung designed an interactive film that takes users through the camera’s various capabilities and navigation buttons. An interactive menu allows viewers to select whatever topics they wish to learn more about and instruct them on how.</p>
<h3 id="vr-and-ar">VR and AR</h3>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyjp4hmcm/image/upload/v1651645159/virtual_reality_g54b15cf60_1280_79b271e257.png" alt="Virtual reality image"></p>
<p>Virtual and augmented reality are two new and successful techniques to give students real-world experience. Virtual reality is ideal for learning both human relationships and practical skills in real-world circumstances. Simulations allow you to practice reenacting real-life incidents and choose the best course of action.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>As instructional designers or training developers, you strive to create corporate learning solutions that will assist your learners to improve their knowledge using the most effective approaches. It is critical to provide content that is simple for the learner to comprehend and remember. We hope that our blog has offered some valuable insights on how to develop your eLearning content.</p>
