  <div class="article__content"><p>If you’ve made the very exciting decision to embark on a barge holiday in France, you’ve no doubt spent many hours thinking about all that time you’ll have to relax, see the countryside and enjoy spectacular food and wine alongside likeminded people. However, if this is your first time experiencing this wonderful way to explore a country (or even if you just haven’t been for a long time) it can be very helpful to know what to pack.
It can be very easy to get lost in the excitement of an upcoming trip and forget the essentials, but with this handy list of suggestions and tips you’ll be sure to enjoy your barge holiday in France in style.</p>
<h2 id="watch-the-weather">Watch the Weather</h2>
<p>Chances are, you’ll experience wonderful weather while on-board, but you can never be too careful and forgetting an essential piece of clothing can have uncomfortable and disappointing consequences. Just to cover all avenues, it’s a great idea to bring along a raincoat for any occasional showers, and a jacket or sweatshirt for the evenings certainly wouldn’t go amiss.</p>
<h2 id="pack-light">Pack Light</h2>
<p>The wonderful thing about a trip like this is the informality and ease with which you can go about your day, taking in a wide variety of activities. Even though there is so much to do, you won’t need to bring everything and the kitchen sink. Good outdoorsy clothes and a couple of changes of smart-casual will set you up for any eventuality. Packing light is a smart way to simplify the preparation process and gives you more time to plan what you’ll do on your holiday instead.</p>
<h2 id="get-walking">Get Walking</h2>
<p>Anyone who takes a barge holiday in France spends a lot of time relaxing as the boat works its way along the water. However, you’ll also be on land regularly and no doubt doing quite a bit of walking. Trainers or walking shoes allow you to get from vineyard to restaurant in comfort, and because the tone of these trips is never overly formal, comfortable footwear is an absolute must to bring along.</p>
<h2 id="charge-in-europe">Charge in Europe</h2>
<p>For many of us it’s been a while since we last went continental. For that reason alone it can be easy to forget some of the really basic things, one of which is a European adaptor for the plug sockets. Pack this as a priority so you can guarantee having enough charge to get dozens of great pictures of your barge holiday in France as well as keep in touch with people back at home.</p>
<h2 id="plan-for-the-unexpected">Plan for the Unexpected</h2>
<p>One of the great things about a holiday that really takes you places is that you never know exactly what’s going to come next. It’s a good idea to review the daily itinerary that your barge will be following, though. See a fancy restaurant with a dress code nearby? A very enticing golf course? It might be wise to pack with these things in mind, just in case they take your fancy en route.</p>
<h2 id="ready-to-depart">Ready to Depart?</h2>
<p>As well as essential items and clothing, it’s crucial to remember to relax and have fun. One of the best ways to ensure you’re calm and prepared is to book your barging holiday with a reputable operator. They know exactly what they’re doing and have decades of experience, which will translate into a fantastic trip.</p>
