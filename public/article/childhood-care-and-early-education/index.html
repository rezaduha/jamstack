  <div class="article__content"><p>Early childhood is the time of child brain development. At this time parents have to give focus on child care and early education because at this time child develop their minds and acquire learning and reading skills. These skills help in deciding the great future of children. So parents have to give due care to child development and early childhood education.</p>
<p>The intelligence power and thinking skills of children developed in early childhood. So early childhood education is good for child development because this education will lead to child’s to acquire values, beliefs, and manners. They also help in gaining leadership skills, great qualities that will make your child unique from others and gain great advantage on others that will, in turn, help your child to get a successful career.</p>
<p>So early childhood education is important and it must be done by parents to help their child to acquire great skills that will help them to set their careers and a better future.</p>
<p>It is a parent&rsquo;s duty to make their child competitive and smart for having a better career or future. Parents should pay more focus on child care and early education so they are able to develop their mind and brain well so they are able to live a great life in their future. At the time of childhood child’s doesn’t have that much mind and sense they just grab all thing that going around them and learns all those things that elders and parents tell them.</p>
<p>So parents must prepare their child well in their childhood by early education so they are able to acquire a skill that will lead them on the right career path.</p>
<p>Most parents recognize that music and movement lessons can have a positive influence on their children, but they underestimate the abilities of younger children. Some don&rsquo;t know that there are early childhood music programs designed just for babies and toddlers, while others assume that their young children can&rsquo;t understand music, much less create music on their own. These parents are very wrong, as young children explore and learn from music every day.</p>
<p>This makes many parents wonder at what age their children should start with music and movement lessons. The answer is simple: ASAP!</p>
<p>Newborn babies can begin to explore music and movement in their own homes with the company of their parents. Parents can hold the babies in their arms and dance with them, and spend time singing for them. Parents can also introduce physical movements by moving their babies&rsquo; legs and arms while singing to them. This can become an excellent bonding time for parents and read this guide.</p>
<p>Once the baby can lift her head and begin to roll over and play with her own fingers and toes, parents can take her music and movement lessons to the next level. They can allow babies to dance alone by holding their arms with their feet on the floor. They can also encourage babies to start singing simple songs, with the understanding that they will not speak all the words correctly. What is important is the development of language and the enjoyment of music and movement.</p>
<p>At the age of three or four, babies are ready for early childhood music programs, with their parents as active participants. These programs are generally designed for children under the age of eight or nine and will expose children to a variety of musical instruments, as well as theories about dance and movement.</p>
