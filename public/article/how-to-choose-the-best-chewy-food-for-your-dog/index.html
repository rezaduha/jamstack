  <div class="article__content"><p>Every pet owner wants to offer the best food, and healthy diet for their four-footed loved dog. A high-quality dog food includes meeting the nutritional standards that are set by AAFCO (Association of American Feed control officials).</p>
<p><strong>High-Quality Dog Food should Contain the following Nutritional Ingredients</strong></p>
<p>Protein that helps in building or repairing tissues, offering energy, helps to promote growth and transport nutrients Fatty acids that help in maintaining healthy skin Amino acids that strengthen the immune system Vitamins and minerals that met your dog’s nutritional requirements</p>
<h2 id="things-to-consider">Things to Consider</h2>
<p>Don’t be deceived by brands&rsquo; enticing packaging and glossy slogans while buying chewy food for them. Their food must not have proteins /generic fats such as meat meals or animal fat. Their food must include lamb meal, chicken fat, and beef fat. If you see generic fats, it will indicate poor quality food with unknown sources. Although poultry fat is not regarded as bad animal fat, chicken fat is considered the best.</p>
<p>Look for dog foods that use ingredients like human-grade meats instead of meats discarded by human food industries. Don’t feed your pet food items that include generic ingredients such as anal fat, meat, meat, and bone. You should use antibiotic-free and hormone-free meats which have high quality and are especially pasture raised or even free range.</p>
<p>Don’t feed them corn gluten meals as they include incomplete protein and are considered an inexpensive waste food product by the human food industry. Also, avoid wheat gluten meal that causes death and illness since it is a cheap source of poor-quality protein.</p>
<h3 id="dry-high-quality-dog-food">Dry High-Quality Dog Food</h3>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyjp4hmcm/image/upload/v1651636169/hand_putting_dog_treats_on_bowl_843_31fe7e6301.jpg" alt="Hand putting dog treats on bowl image"></p>
<p>It is a convenient and popular dog food choice. Make your dogs eat dry chewy food, which helps them keep their teeth clean and keep away dental issues. For example, you can use protein sources like farm-raised turkey and add some chickpeas, peas, and flaxseeds instead of using dairy products, corn, and wheat, which are considered potential allergens. This is crunchy and chewy, and fit for any age.</p>
<h3 id="high-protein-diet">High Protein Diet</h3>

<p>Such foods include high protein content than average dog food. Average pet food contains 22-28% protein, whereas a high protein diet contains 32% protein. For example, you can add lamb beef and a mix of freeze-dried raw bits and kibble, a high protein food.</p>
<h3 id="natural-dog-food">Natural Dog Food</h3>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyjp4hmcm/image/upload/v1651635991/dalmatian_dog_eating_fruits_770363_f5f380e5f5.jpg" alt="Dalmatian dog eating fruits image"></p>
<p>This type of food is devoid of artificial preservatives, coloring, and flavorings. It’s a good food choice for dogs of any age.</p>
<h3 id="freeze-dried--dehydrated-food">Freeze Dried &amp; Dehydrated Food</h3>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyjp4hmcm/image/upload/v1651636700/dog_bones_pet_dog_food_50093_d05561302d.jpg" alt="Dog bones pet dog food image"></p>
<p>Such types of chewy food have no moisture and are high in protein. The only difference is that freeze-dried dog food can be fed easily, whereas dehydrated food must be mixed with warm water. For example, freeze-dried raw chewy chicken dinner patties have a chewy texture and fir for dogs who don’t like enjoying traditional kibble.</p>
<h3 id="raw-dog-food">Raw Dog Food</h3>

<p>Raw dog food has high-quality ingredients, including carbohydrates, protein bases, and raw meat. This helps to improve your pet’s digestion and lowers shedding.</p>
