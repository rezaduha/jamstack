  <div class="article__content"><p>US is effectively witnessing rapid digital transformation all over a wide range of fields, and market sentiment suggests that this transformation may only be the starting of what’s to come.</p>
<p>The whole tech transformation has created an entirely new segment that is presently the main topic of conversation in India, Smart Homes, which is estimated to rise to more than $14 billion by 2026.</p>
<p>According to current buyer behavior, people constantly realize the value of transforming or enhancing their homes into home automation. The increasing adoption of innovative home products in India demonstrates that it is only time before each urban house owner can confidently seek to live in a smart home.</p>
<p><strong>What is a Smart Home?</strong></p>
<p>A smart home uses an intelligent device to manage or digitize daily tasks. These homes are usually built around the central hub that enables interaction between several devices in the house.Biosensors, intelligent thermometers, wall adapters, gadgets, moisture sensors, door and window sensor systems, motion detectors, and many other embedded systems are elements of these devices. A smart home, like a smartphone, can automate many more of your housework.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-smart-home-security-systems-and-how-does-it-work">What is Smart Home Security Systems and How Does it Work?</h2>
<p>A home security system comprises a variety of electronic components that connect with a centralized location and work to protect a home from attackers, natural disasters and any accidents.</p>
<p>The primary goal of a home security system is to protect your property and the people who live in it. A breaking, violent assault, fire, storm, or another natural disaster can all cause damage. Most security systems can keep an eye out for all of these. These systems employ a network of sensors that share information via radio transmissions or cables to a centralized location, which is then conveyed to the outside world via a data connection or, in some cases, a landline. The gateway is generally a mobile device mounted on your ceiling or a small box positioned on a counter or in a cabinet.</p>
<p>The sensors are strategically placed throughout your homes, such as at entry points like doors and the first doors and in halls and elevated areas. They identify when a window or door is opened and closed and when someone moves around and in your house. When the system is activated, it sends a notification to the hub when a sensor is triggered. If you have professional surveillance, the center will sound an alarm, send a report, and can alert a monitoring system.</p>
