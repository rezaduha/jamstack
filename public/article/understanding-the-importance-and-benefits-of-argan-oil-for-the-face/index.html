  <div class="article__content"><p>Argan oil comes from the kernels of dried Argan fruit produced by the Argan trees that are native to the desert region of Morocco. The local Berber people have traditionally used this oil for culinary, medicinal, and cosmetic purposes. In its purest form, the suitability of Argan oil for the face, hair, and nails applications is well-proven. That is why it is increasingly popular as an essential ingredient in shampoos, soaps, conditioners, lip glosses, and many other cosmetic products.</p>
<p>Not only is Argan oil safe for direct skin application, but it also contains a variety of therapeutic elements and vitamins that work together to improve skin health. You are not likely to experience any instances of skin irritation after applying this oil. You might find it beneficial instead for reducing acne, preventing oily skin, providing sunburn protection, and healing various severe skin conditions.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-argan-oil-for-face-application">Benefits of Argan oil for face application</h2>
<p>The golden Argan oil contains a high concentration of vitamin E, fatty acids, and antioxidants. These restoring nutrients nourish the skin and act as excellent natural moisturizers. By using Argan oil for the face, you can reap these benefits:</p>
<h3 id="1-it-can-treat-acne">1. It can treat acne</h3>
<p>Hormonal acne is often the consequence of an excess of sebum produced as a result of hormonal changes. The sebum clogs the skin pores and causes blackheads and acne. Argan oil contains anti-sebum properties that may help control the quantity of sebum produced by the skin properly. As it is also non-comedogenic, there will be no issue about it adding to the problem and clogging your skin pores.</p>
<p>It may instead aid in preventing further acne breakouts. It may reduce skin inflammation, heal damaged skin cells and fade post-acne scars. By regularly cleansing your face and applying Argan oil at least twice a day, it may be possible to develop a smoother and clearer complexion.</p>
<h3 id="2-it-can-have-an-anti-aging-effect">2. It can have an anti-aging effect</h3>
<p>Due to the natural aging process, the skin begins to lose its moisture content and develop wrinkles. By regularly massaging a few drops of Argan oil into your skin, it may be possible to remedy this situation to an extent. The vitamin E content in Argan oil gives it regenerative properties that can enhance the rate of skin renewal.</p>
<p>With its excellent moisturizing properties, Argan oil can penetrate your skin deeply and prevent it from becoming dry and flaky. It can restore its natural suppleness and help reduce wrinkles. Your skin will soon start to look smooth, luminous, and youthful.</p>
<h3 id="3-it-can-protect-from-sun-related-damage">3. It can protect from sun-related damage</h3>
<p>The antioxidants in Argan oil can help protect and heal your skin from damage caused by over-exposure to the sun. Aside from sunburn, your skin could suffer from hyperpigmentation and develop dark spots. The condition occurs when the skin produces too much melanin from excessive sun exposure. The components in Argan oil can prevent melanin formation in the skin, and that is why a topical application of Argan oil may be enough to reduce oxidative stress and stop skin damage.</p>
