  <div class="article__content"><p>English is a language that is full of synonyms, homophones homonyms that seem to make it especially difficult to learn. Enhancing your English language skills is something that you will undoubtedly develop in your career in your lifetime. There are many proven advantages in enhancing your knowledge of vocabulary, but most people have not spent much time learning new vocabulary since from their childhood. Here are some effective ways to enhance your knowledge of vocabulary to sound smarter.</p>
<h2 id="read-voraciously">Read Voraciously</h2>
<p>The most effective way to get new vocabulary is to keep on reading it. While reading, you can see words used in context, which is the best way than simply memorizing word lists. Reading the new word that surrounds the context information is the best chance to guess its meaning just by understanding the overall text. There are plenty of new words in the English learning app from where you can update your vocabulary knowledge by learning it with the sentence.</p>
<p>Reading the vocabulary with the sentence is one of the natural ways of learning the new vocabulary. You should not be afraid of coming across new words because you cannot succeed in your aim with a lack of confidence.</p>
<h2 id="read-high-literature">Read High Literature</h2>
<p>You can learn many new words by reading as many books as you have the time and inclination for. Try to read high literature books to get more professional in knowing new vocabulary and speaking. Reading nonfiction and technical book will not only teach you new ways to speak but also new ways to think. Instead of sticking to a single subject, read various subjects like philosophy, science and religion. In the spoken English app, you can learn about high-level words that make you appear still more professional in the way you speak.</p>
<h2 id="set-a-goal">Set a goal</h2>
<p>Set a goal for yourself in building your vocabulary. A good and healthy commitment is very important when you plan to do something. For instance, you can commit to learn three new words a week and work them into your speech and writing, or as per your requirement and convenience, you can fix the number of words you need per day or per week. The important thing is you have to implement those words in your speech or writing to get more familiar with those words.</p>
<h2 id="lookup-any-words-you-dont-recognize">Lookup any words you don’t recognize</h2>
<p>You should not skip the unfamiliar words when you come across them. Instead of skipping, try to find the possible meaning in the context of the sentence by looking it up in the dictionary or other sources. If you want, you can also make a note of new words for better remembrance in future.</p>
<p>Maintaining a personal lexicon can help you to review those words later when required. If you feel that going back and refreshing your memory on recent words can be difficult, then keep the words in your own list to make it more efficient. Even though you are not referring to your lexicon, writing new words will improve your ability to commit them to your permanent memory.</p>
<h2 id="use-visuals">Use visuals</h2>
<p>The undying fact is that 50% of the brain’s resources are used upon vision alone, which means people spend half of their brainpower on noticing motion, shapes and colours around us. Human eyes are not only power-hungry, but they are also sponges for information. To speed up the learning process, try using image-based flashcards or adding pictures to your vocabulary definitions. By using visual aids, you can remember the new words even more easily than other methods.</p>
<h2 id="get-some-sleep">Get some sleep</h2>
<p>Most people know that sleep plays a big role in learning new things that is when you learn something new and have a nap before being tested on it, you will be more likely to remember it than if you were tested after an interval that didn&rsquo;t include any sleep. Short term memories include things you have just learned, so, during sleep, your short term memories just consolidate into your long term memory.</p>
<p>This process can’t take place when you don’t go to sleep, so you are more likely to lose the information you just learned. It improves the ability to learn a lot of new things easily and remember for a long time.</p>
<h2 id="play-and-have-fun">Play and have fun</h2>
<p>Engaging in group activities and playing games will be very useful in any kind of learning and particularly effective for language-related learning. You can play word games together with your family or friends. You can have more interesting learning sessions in online spoken English training, which will enhance your interest in learning new things.</p>
<p>There are numerous options for word games on the internet, so you can use them if you don’t have time or don’t want to engage in group activities. If you are almost good at speaking, you can play them when you are bored, or you can incorporate them into your daily routine if you are looking to improve your language.</p>
<h2 id="follow-a-process">Follow a process</h2>
<p>You should make the process as habitual, automatic, and tightly integrated into your daily workflow as possible to make vocabulary improvement as a permanent habit in your everyday life. If you are not following the process, then you might skip the process when your days get too busy. You can stick the word in a predefined place you use to process them much more efficiently.</p>
<p>You will stay on top of your vocabulary improvement process by knowing exactly how and how often to process your inbox. You can also make your convenient way for incorporating the newly learned words in your daily routine to familiarise yourself with the new words.</p>
<h3 id="wrapping-it-up">Wrapping it up</h3>
<p>Following the above-mentioned points can highly help you in enhancing your knowledge of vocabulary to sound smarter. Other than this, there are many ways to improve your knowledge of English vocabulary. The only thing is you have to know the exact meaning of the word you learning because, without the proper understanding, it might be difficult for you to remember those words.</p>
