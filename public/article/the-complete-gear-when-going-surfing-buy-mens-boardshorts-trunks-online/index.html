  <div class="article__content"><p>To surfers, the water and waves could either be your best friend or worst foe. And with such a dangerous sport or hobby, it is only important to always wear complete and proper equipment when going surfing. Buying surfing equipment can be as easy as typing Buy mens boardshorts trunks online, but it might seem confusing as to what are the essential equipment and what the function of each is. In this article, we would be enumerating the different equipment you should have when riding the waves.</p>
<h2 id="surfboard">Surfboard</h2>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyjp4hmcm/image/upload/v1651633511/assorted_colors_of_surfboard_75713_76a1406119.jpg" alt="Assorted colors of surfboard image"></p>
<p>Of course, it’s already so obvious. There is a reason why HippyTree Mens Surfboard Shirts have surfboard designs on them. The first gear to prepare when surfing is the surfboard of course. These boards are your “magic carpet” when riding the waves. If you are a beginner, you should want to choose bigger and soft top boards.</p>
<h2 id="fins">Fins</h2>

<p>Now that you have your board, you should next secure the fins. Fins ensure stability and drive to your board. There are different kinds of fins, depending on your skill level and preference. The most popular types are the single-fin, double-fin, quad, five-fin, and the thruster setups.</p>
<h2 id="leash">Leash</h2>

<p>The leash is pretty straightforward. It connects the surfboard to the surfer. If ever a big wave swipes you from your board, you won’t need to look around frantically searching for it. With the leash, your board would just be right next to you.</p>
<h2 id="surf-waxtraction-pad">Surf Wax/Traction Pad</h2>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyjp4hmcm/image/upload/v1651634552/surf_wax_353850_b7e6f8c948.jpg" alt="Surf wax image"></p>
<p>Surfers apply surf wax unto their surfboard to help the surfers keep a grip on their boards. Surf wax requires regular application on the board, while there are the traction pads. Traction pads, like their name, are every much like surf wax, but they last years if properly applied.</p>
<h2 id="wetsuit">Wetsuit</h2>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyjp4hmcm/image/upload/v1651634740/white_surfboard_with_wetsuit_Wk_Md_Yfta_a419468fb1.jpg" alt="White surfboard with wetsuit image"></p>
<p>Wetsuits are made of neoprene and keep the surfers warm in long exposure to the water. Wetsuits come in two types: spring suit and full suit. Choose one depends on the temperature of the water. Wetsuits also have varying thickness levels (2mm, 3/2mm, and 4/3mm).</p>
