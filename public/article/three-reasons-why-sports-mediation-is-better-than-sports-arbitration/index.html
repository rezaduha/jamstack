  <div class="article__content"><p>The habits of people have changed considerably at sporting events. You find many people that primarily do not look at their surroundings at all. They seem to be looking at their smartphones and electronic devices as if someone is talking to them already. Other than this, some people cannot take their eyes off mobiles because they read emails or watch videos or play games. And as finding such people is an everyday routine, we should embrace the fact that life has become very fast. Otherwise, such curiosity could not become such a norm. Another aspect of this fast-paced life is that face-to-face communications have become a thing of the past. Even direct and straightforward messages can be interpreted in complex and sensitive ways. Sports people are well-aware of this situation. To focus on their performance, they prefer to settle it via sports mediators when they have issues with a player, sponsor, or team management. And this gives them several advantages that would be otherwise impossible in case they adopt sports arbitration. Let’s look at these benefits one by one.</p>
<h2 id="sports-mediation-saves-money-and-time">Sports Mediation Saves Money and Time</h2>
<p>Although the service fees of mediation attorneys are equal to the expenses of expert attorneys at labor law, the process of sports mediation takes much shorter than arbitration would take. And this time saving also means less spending on attorney fees due to their reaching quick settlements through mediations. As a result, the players free themselves from various legal hassles to avoid severe penalties on time.</p>
<h2 id="mediators-control-outcomes-unlike-unpredictable-juries">Mediators Control Outcomes Unlike Unpredictable Juries</h2>
<p>The number of people in a jury is different, and each of them has his own beliefs and perspectives. So then, while the judge agrees with you, the jury can have a different opinion, and even if one juror has a distinct and harsh opinion that goes against you, this will become made public. And the final decision of the type of take-it-or-leave-it-like creates misunderstandings of the extent to which players cannot concentrate during play-offs. In contrast, the mediators mediate to resolve the disputes with a resolution agreeable to both parties. And the mediators further ensure the privacy of information. Certain parts or the whole details of a dispute resolution process can be kept secret that would otherwise reach the public domain during sports arbitration.</p>
<h2 id="changing-positions-is-possible">Changing Positions Is Possible</h2>
<p>The mediators can mutually agree to propose agreeable positions to their parties, and the parties are free to accept or reject their suggestions to resolve a dispute quickly. However, if the parties agree to change positions for a quick settlement, the conflict resolves, with only final decisions made public. Moreover, even if the final decision has come out, both parties choose whether to choose or reject the conclusion reached at the end of a mediation process.</p>
<p>So, suppose the sports mediators have experience in resolving sports disputes. In that case, they can use their past experiences to walk their clients through complex situations to drive to resolutions agreeable to all.</p>
<p>So that is why the first choice of most sportspeople is mediation at the earliest stages of a dispute with another party. However, if both parties get entrenched into their positions during mediation, reaching a dispute resolution is not possible through mediation. In such a case, either party can drive the other party to sports arbitration.</p>
