  <div class="article__content"><p>Football is one of the most famous and most followed games worldwide. It is also one of the easiest sports to play. One just needs a fluffy ball and a net only to enjoy the charms of football. But since people now have become busier, they cannot play football due to time constraints. But still, they can enjoy the beauty of football. It is seen among many football fans that they follow both online and offline viewing of football matches. But in the times of the Covid pandemic, the viewership of online football matches has increased drastically.</p>
<p>So let us see the benefits of watching football online:</p>
<p><strong>1. Less Time Taking</strong></p>
<p>Watching football on online platforms saves a huge amount of time. When you plan to watch the football match physically, you first invest time to buy tickets, and in tight fight matches, even tickets booking takes a lot of time. Then going to the stadium, finding the seat, all these processes take a lot of time. During the match and even after the match, you drive back home, just spending your precious time. So it is better to watch the game online than to see it physically.</p>
<p><strong>2. Online Viewing Gives a Better View of the Game</strong></p>
<p>If you are watching the game in the stadium, your focus is very limited. You cannot see the main player all the time due to distance. But if you are watching football online, you automatically get the best view without any extra effort, and that too in crystal clear ultra-high definition. Also, you get all the attractions in the stadium at your fingertips, on your smartphone&rsquo;s display.</p>
<p><strong>3. Statistics of Each Player</strong></p>
<p>You can get the lifetime statistics of every player on the field if you are watching the football game online. But you will not get the same when you are physically present at the stadium. It is also a boon for real fans of the game.</p>
<p><strong>4. Saves Money</strong></p>
<p>If money is not everything, it is also not less than anything. We all strive for more and more money, and if you want to save real money and that too without doing anything, even you will rejoice, watch your favorite game, football, online. Because these days, ticket prices are booming and have increased dramatically, whereas online streaming subscription rates are very low and affordable. So it will be recommended to you to buy a subscription of football online rather than to go to the stadium and watch physically.</p>
<p><strong>5. Convenience</strong></p>
<p>There is no convenience in watching football at the stadium. If you want to go to the bathroom, it becomes very difficult. Whereas watching football online is very convenient, you can watch it anywhere you want. No matter where you are, which smartphone you have, you will have access to the thrill of the football match. So, if you like convenience, then go for online streaming.</p>
<p>These were some of the benefits that one will get by watching football online. And in the times of the Covid pandemic, these reasons to watch online have solidified even more.</p>
