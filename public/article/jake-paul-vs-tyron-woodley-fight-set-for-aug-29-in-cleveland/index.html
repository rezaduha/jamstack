  <div class="article__content"><p><strong>Tyron Woodley&rsquo;s boxing debut versus Jake Paul has a venue.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://jakepaulvswoodley.com/">Jake Paul vs Tyron Woodley Live Stream</a> will headline a Showtime Boxing pay-per-view event on Sunday, Aug. 29, at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in Cleveland, Showtime announced Monday. Paul grew up in Cleveland.</p>
<p>“I grew up attending to Cavs, Browns, and Indians games on weekends, fantasizing as a young child of one day being in a position to put on a show for my city like they did,” Paul stated in a press release. “On August 29th, that dream will come true. My greatest challenge to date, in front of the city that created me, on pay-per-view for the whole world to watch me knock out a UFC champion.”</p>
<p>The battle will go eight rounds at a catchweight of 190 pounds. Paul and Woodley are set to square off again at a press conference in Los Angeles on Tuesday. Their initial clash lasted almost four minutes, with obscenities flying back and forth.</p>
<p>Paul (3-0 boxing) made news in April when he <a href="https://www.badlefthook.com/2021/4/18/22389805/jake-paul-vs-ben-askren-results-highlights-knockout-fight-video-triller-boxing-news-2021">knocked out former Bellator and ONE Championship champion Ben Askren in the opening round</a> of a Triller Fight Club boxing event. Paul&rsquo;s last two wins were against NBA veteran Nate Robinson and YouTuber Ali Eson Gib.
Woodley has already stated his desire for the fight, <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2021/05/tyron-woodley-wants-to-box-culture-vulture-jake-paul-mma-ufc">publicly challenging Paul in an interview with TMZ</a>.</p>
<p>“Come and grab this smoke for real,” Woodley urged. “I&rsquo;m in, and I know where he is.” People who keep talking about battling him aren&rsquo;t even in a position to fight him. I can really fight him.”</p>
<p>Woodley (19-7-1 MMA, 9-6-1 UFC) is presently rated No. 11 in the newest USA TODAY Sports/MMA Junkie welterweight rankings. After an eight-year career in MMA&rsquo;s largest organization, the former UFC champion recently called his quits. “The Chosen One” finished his octagon career on a four-fight losing streak, surrendering his championship to current champ Kamaru Usman before falling to current top contenders Gilbert Burns, Colby Covington, and Vicente Luque.</p>
<p>“I&rsquo;m a grown-up man,” Woodley said. “I don&rsquo;t play games with kids. They took me in to take out the garbage. You&rsquo;re welcome.”</p>
