  <div class="article__content"><p>The programme encompasses data Science as an interdisciplinary, problem-solving oriented subject that learns to apply scientific techniques to practical problems.</p>
<p>Data Science is an exponentially growing field that involves a blend of data inference, algorithm development, and technology to analytically solve complex problems. Some of the Universities conduct BTech Data Science whereas some conducts BTech in Computer Science with specialisation in Data Science &amp; Analytics. The core of any of these programmes is the ultimate use of enormous data in creative ways to generate business value.</p>
<h2 id="btech-data-science-scope">BTech Data Science Scope</h2>
<p>Nowadays, Data Science is a buzzword in the technology world. Day-to-day technological evolutions and the generation of huge amounts of data have led to the high demand for Data Scientists across the globe. The importance of gathering and collecting data is crucial as it enables organisations to determine and thus influence the trends in a particular industry. The use of data analytics in almost every industry has contributed to a huge demand of Data Scientist. Here are some major industries with a high demand for data scientists:</p>
<ul>
<li>E-commerce</li>
<li>Manufacturing</li>
<li>Banking &amp; Finance</li>
<li>Healthcare</li>
<li>Transport</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="benefits-of-btech-data-science">Benefits of BTech Data Science</h2>
<p>Though BTech in Computer Science with specialisation in Data Science &amp; Analytics or BTech Data Science is a trending course, but only a few colleges are offering this course. It is why the supply of Data Science graduates is low despite their high demand. However, there are several perks attached with this course. Few of them are discussed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>The course gives you the knowledge and skills of both the data sciences and computer related technological aspects.</li>
<li>The course is in huge demand in industrial areas and is accepted globally.</li>
<li>You can grab a good salary package or raise in salary depending on the experience and skills you hold.</li>
<li>This course opens you to a wider range of lucrative job opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="skills-required-to-pursue-btech-data-science">Skills required to pursue BTech Data Science</h2>
<p>Skills other than academics are also known as soft skills that impact the efficiency and ability to perform the technical aspects of any job. Few of them are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interest in making new discoveries and learning new things</li>
<li>Ingenuity to solve hard problems and clarity of thinking</li>
<li>Good critical thinking using numerical skill</li>
<li>Good communication and presentation skills</li>
<li>Immense intellectual curiosity</li>
<li>Algorithmic thinker</li>
<li>Passion for problem solving</li>
<li>Strategic business intuition</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="btech-data-science-job-profiles">BTech Data Science Job Profiles</h2>
<p>Let us take a sneak peek into some of the Data Science job roles. Data Science jobs for freshers may include the job of a business analyst, data scientist, statistician or data architect.</p>
<p>Big Data Engineer: They develop, maintain, test, and evaluate big data solutions within organisations.</p>
<p>Machine Learning Engineer: Responsible to design and implement machine learning applications/algorithms to address business challenges.</p>
<p>Data Engineer/Data Architect: Responsible to develop, construct, test, and maintain highly scalable data management systems.</p>
<p>Data Scientist: These professionals understand the challenges of business and offer the best solutions using data analysis and data processing.</p>
<p>Statistician: Responsible to interpret the results, along with strategic recommendations or incisive predictions, using data visualization tools or reports.</p>
<p>Data Analysts: Involved in data manipulations and data visualization.</p>
<p>Business Analysts: Use predictive, prescriptive, and descriptive analyses to transform complex data into easily understood actionable insights for the users.</p>
