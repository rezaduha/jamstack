  <div class="article__content"><p><strong>WHAT MAKES POWER BI UNIQUE?</strong></p>
<p>Power BI has many features, including a data modeling tool with a user-friendly interface and a multi-layered business solution. Any BI tool is made up of three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raw Data: The data acquired from the data source is presented in an unstructured format.</li>
<li>Reports: Reports are the output of any BI tool that displays the data in a graphical way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Power BI fully supports all three layers. The majority of other Data Analytics solutions are solely focused on report generation, with only minimal functionality from the first two components. This tool&rsquo;s main goal is to give the best BI utilities, Business Intelligence reports, and analytics features to its users. This software includes a cloud-based service feature in the desktop-based interface. It&rsquo;s a one-stop-shop for business intelligence, with features including data discovery, data transformation, and graphically engaging dashboards. Power BI focuses on data modeling and report development rather than visualization. From the unified dashboard, you can easily generate reports with a few clicks.</p>
<p>Other data sources can also be connected with this tool by using the appropriate connections and drivers. You can also select a scalable dashboard for optimal visualization.</p>
<p>Before comparing Power BI to other BI tools, here are the top features to be aware of.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dashboard is Simple to Use</li>
<li>Add a Data Source</li>
<li>Visualization that is personalized</li>
<li>The language of nature Report Generation for Q&amp;A</li>
<li>Report Generation for Q&amp;A</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of the other BI tools available on the market include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tableau</li>
<li>SSRS</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="power-bi-vs-tableau">Power BI Vs Tableau</h2>
<p><strong>Data Access</strong>: Power BI connects directly to Salesforce and Google Analytics, but not to the Hadoop database. Tableau has the ability to connect directly to Hadoop. To be honest, most industries do not require the Hadoop feature because it deals with massive amounts of data. Most businesses are small to medium-sized and do not require such extensive data processing.</p>
<p><strong>Visualization</strong>: Microsoft&rsquo;s tool includes 3500 data points for analyzing your dataset and making decisions using predictive analytics consulting. even if you have no programming skills, you can still do it. Natural language queries are possible. Tableau is well-known for its visual data presentation, but it requires some prior coding experience to use. Tableau has about 24 baseline visualizations.</p>
<p>Power BI is only available in one deployment mode, SaaS BI (Software as a Service). On the other side of the fence, Tableau is available in two models: cloud and client machine installation. Depending on how much data you have, you can choose between cloud and installation formats. When there is a large amount of data, it is advised to use a cloud model.</p>
<h2 id="power-bi-vs-ssrs">Power BI Vs SSRS</h2>
<p>Power BI is free, whereas SSRS requires a SQL Server license to run. To use PBIRS, however, you must first purchase a Power BI Premium license.</p>
<p>Power BI is available as a SaaS (software as a service) in the cloud (software as a service). SSRS is a component that is installed on a server.</p>
<p>Power BI has sophisticated graphical capabilities. SSRS is a more traditional type of software that requires manual intervention to create reports and analyze data.</p>
<p>In the case of Power BI, you can use cloud data, but SSRS can only handle on-premise data.</p>
<p>The successor to SSRS is PBIRS, or Power BI Report Server. It supports both PBIX and analytical XLSX reports. SSRS does not support either of these.</p>
<p>PBI has been upgraded to include Cortana integration for Natural Language Processing. This feature is not supported by SSRS.</p>
<p>Power BI has a user-friendly interface with drag-and-drop functionality for creating reports. Unlike other BI tools such as Tableau, you can use it without any programming knowledge.</p>
<p>Power BI enables the use of unstructured data, modern rendering techniques, and seamless integration across multiple platforms. With built-in features, multiple data cubes can be integrated.</p>
<p>As you can see, even the free version of Power BI contains a lot of sophisticated capabilities that other BI tools don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>It can also be used without any coding knowledge.</p>
<p>Power BI is inexpensive and accessible, even in enterprise editions, making it accessible to small and medium-sized organizations.</p>
