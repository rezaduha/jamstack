  <div class="article__content"><p>Acne and pigmentation are welcomed by none. And for those with Dry skin, dealing with this could be no less than an unpleasant dream.</p>
<p>Dry skin is the most sensitive of all skin types. This makes it more prone to rashes, acne, dark spots and pigmentation. Exposure to UV rays and free radical damage results in skin irritation as well.</p>
<p>Daily skin care is important to get your skin ready everyday, especially when you have a dry skin type. The products you choose must have ingredients that can lock the moisture in, balance the skin pH and prevent the skin barrier. Also, they must prevent the skin from everyday environmental damage. However, choosing the appropriate product for Dry skin is a crucial task.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s help you have a simple and fuss free skin care regimen</strong></p>
<h2 id="double-cleansing-just-saves-the-day">Double cleansing just saves the day</h2>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyjp4hmcm/image/upload/v1651635443/women_skin_toner_g1457990a_76b238124b.jpg" alt="Women skin toner image"></p>
<p>Double cleansing your skin aids it to break down dirt and impurities, keeping it balanced and healthy. However, it is necessary to choose the right cleanser combination, when you have dry skin type or you can run into a disaster.</p>
<p>Harsh cleansers can rip off the healthy lipids and ceramides making the skin even more drier. Oil-based cleansers are generally recommended. You can opt for cleansing balms infused with shea butter, hemp or coconut oil followed by PHA-based cleanser. It’ll help you boost hydration and prevent the skin’s lipid barrier. Do not forget to moisturize your skin.</p>
<h2 id="a-hydrating-face-wash-works-wonders">A hydrating face wash works wonders</h2>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyjp4hmcm/image/upload/v1651635835/soap_dispenser_soap_liquid_soap_23376_c72864e743.jpg" alt="Soap dispenser image"></p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t wash your face everyday, the probability of breakouts could increase due to clogged pores with dirt and other pollutants. But It isn’t easier to choose just the right cleanser when you have dry skin. The product should be hydrating, soothing and skin pH friendly at the same time.</p>
<p>However, if you look for these three ingredients in any product, you’ll win the game. Always choose the face wash that contain the ingredients like: <strong>Hyaluronic acid</strong>, <strong>Niacinamide</strong>, <strong>Glycerin</strong>.</p>
<p>Any cleanser with the mentioned ingredients, could revive your skin. They are an extra punch of hydration, aids maintaining skin pH and reduces pigmentation.</p>
<h2 id="exfoliation-revives-the-skin">Exfoliation revives the skin</h2>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyjp4hmcm/image/upload/v1651635539/medicinal_flower_gbd295bd6c_1280_dc69151e0e.jpg" alt="Medicinal flower image"></p>
<p>Dealing with acne and pigmentation on dry skin can be more easy if you follow exfoliation in your skin care regime. If not, you must include the same.</p>
<p>Exfoliating twice or thrice in a week can get you the best results.</p>
<p>Mandelic or Lactic acid could be an apt choice for those with dry and sensitive skin. Both of them belong to the AHA family. Unlike others, mandelic and lactic acid are gentle exfoliants and an excellent moisturizer making them ideal for sensitive skin types.</p>
<p>The exfoliating action of these, removes the dead skin cells, boosts collagen production accelerating the cell turnover. They diminish pigmentation and brightens the skin tone by reducing acne.</p>
<p><strong>Reduces acne and Pigmentation</strong></p>
<h2 id="serums-are-best-for-skin-nourishment">Serums are best for skin nourishment</h2>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dyjp4hmcm/image/upload/v1651635625/face_serum_gffc6b764a_1280_ffa16c13e9.jpg" alt="Face serum image"></p>
<p>Niacinamide and Vitamin-C based serums are an extra dose of nourishment for skin. When it comes to acne and pigmentation issues, serums could be a great choice.</p>
<p>Vitamin-C based serums are best to introduce in your morning skin care regime. Being a natural brightening agent, vitamin-C, lessens blemishes and dark spots on the skin. It increases the infusion of antioxidants to the skin which help in reducing the severity of acne.</p>
<p>Soothing nature of Niacinamide calms down the irritated skin. When used overnight on a daily basis regulates sebum secretion and heals the skin. You can also opt for alpha arbutin serum, which is known to treat pigmentation, sunspots and breakouts. It is rich in antioxidants that protects and nourishes the skin. Azelaic acid could also be an alternative.</p>
<h2 id="follow-up-with-moisturizer">Follow up with moisturizer</h2>

<p>Moisturizing is an essential step of any daily skin care routine. However, for dry skin types, it should have some special ingredients that could not just keep the skin hydrated but also prevent the environmental skin damage when exposed.</p>
<p>These special ingredients are hyaluronic acid and glycerin, as they attract moisture. There should be an apt concentration of oils as well to keep the skin enriched with healthy lipids. You can choose either cream or oil based moisturizer.</p>
<p><strong>Most importantly, let your skin breathe and stay healthy!</strong></p>
