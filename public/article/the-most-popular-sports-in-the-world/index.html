<h2 id="basketball">BASKETBALL</h2>

Players who are the center of attention are LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, and Anthony Davis, to mention only a few. The basketball hoops(basket) is usually 10 foot high, although it can be lower for children. This is where an appreciable height comes to play.

<h2 id="tennis">TENNIS</h2>
<p>Tennis is a sport that will get your heart drumming in your chest as the adrenaline surges through your body with each passing of the ball. This game dates back to the nineteenth century in the United Kingdom.
The game of tennis involves two players, either males or females. Tennis may be played between two players, or two teams consisting of two players each. The main rule of the game is that the ball must land within bound range. If the ball lands outside the range, the player loses points. When a player passes a ball, it is called serving. There are four different types of serve- slice, kick, flat and underhand serve. The serve can be your fuel for victory, or it will ridicule your hopes. When serving, you have complete control of the ball. The tennis ball is relatively smaller than the football or basketball. The ball is very bouncy, making the game easier.

This game is fun, and most schools have facilities on the school ground. A modified form of volleyball may be played in the pool for recreational purposes. The two teams consist of six players each, with a net acting as the barrier. The game requires about three hits for each team. It is important to note that a player cannot block a serve from the 10-foot line. The game of volleyball is an adaptation of basketball. It originates from Massachusetts, where it was an indoor game for those who found basketball extremely demanding.</p>

<h2 id="cricket">CRICKET</h2>
<p>Cricket is an old game of 11 players. The captain determines if the team will bat or bowl first. The most important feature of this game is speed.

The players are in three categories- batsmen, bowler, and fielder. The batsman is responsible for scoring runs. The bowler is in charge of bowling, and the fielders prevent the other team’s batsmen from scoring. The batsmen are the Centre of attraction in a cricket game. The fans are always excited to see what technique they will employ to score a run successfully. Cricketers wear protective equipment to protect themselves from severe injuries.
