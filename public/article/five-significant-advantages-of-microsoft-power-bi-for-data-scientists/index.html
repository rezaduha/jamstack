<h2 id="why-should-you-use-power-bi-as-your-primary-bi-solution">Why should you use Power BI as your primary BI solution?</h2>
<p>Although there are other BI solutions available, Power BI remains a favourite among many enterprises around the world. Its supremacy in this arena is due to a number of factors.</p>
<p><strong>Ease of Use</strong>: Without a doubt, Power BI outperforms competitor BI tools in terms of ease of use. The programme is really sophisticated, but the user interface is straightforward. It can also be highly customised. Even if you&rsquo;ve never used a BI tool before, you should be able to get started without much help. The majority of users adjust to it without difficulty. It offers a user interface that is straightforward and intuitive to use. You won&rsquo;t require any prior programming knowledge. The complex capabilities, on the other hand, will necessitate the assistance of a seasoned Microsoft Power BI developer.</p>
<p><strong>Excellent Integration</strong>: Most firms that install a BI solution have numerous other applications in use, therefore the BI tool must be interoperable with those apps and cloud services. Power BI comes out on top in this category. It&rsquo;s compatible with a variety of Microsoft apps and cloud services. It also works with a variety of third-party software and database systems. This aids in the import of data from multiple sources as well. When using Power BI, businesses don&rsquo;t have to worry about application support.</p>
<p><strong>Extensive Data Visualisation Capabilities</strong>: Simply analysing massive amounts of data is insufficient. A BI tool should include enough data visualisation features to allow the analysed data to be used to create visually appealing reports. Power BI comes with a plethora of data visualisation elements and features. It includes a plethora of maps, graphs, and charts, as well as the ability to use images and other media content. This enables users to make the best use of data while also conveying the message to the intended recipients.</p>
<p><strong>Easy Report Creation and Sharing</strong>: After analysing a massive amount of data from multiple sources, your company must generate useful reports that can be shared with the entire workforce. Report creation is a breeze with Power BI. Using its built-in features, you can create visually appealing reports in a matter of minutes. The generated reports can be shared with other users in a variety of formats. You can even share these reports with people who don&rsquo;t use Power BI. Reports, for example, can be exported in PPT format.</p>
<p><strong>The Flexibility of Use</strong>: If you think BI tools like Power BI are solely used by technological giants and MNCs, you&rsquo;re wrong! The truth is that Power BI is appropriate for use by businesses of all sizes and types. If you have a new or growing business, go with the free version, which has a lot of features. There are license-based cloud versions aimed at customers with deep pockets. It can also be downloaded as a mobile app. As a result, the range of applications is enormous. Power bi professional has corporate customers who swear by it.</p>
<p><strong>Powerful Solution</strong>: Many of the operations performed by Power BI can also be completed using spreadsheet programmes. However, Power BI outperforms the competition when it comes to sheer processing power and the efficient use of computational resources. Large data files can be processed more quickly. When compressing or decompressing data volume, there will be no noticeable delay. It seamlessly connects to supported data sources, and automated data synchronisation collects data at pre-determined intervals.</p>
<p>When you utilise a BI tool that interacts with a large volume of data, protecting the data&rsquo;s security is critical. The good news is that Power BI comes with built-in data security measures. For example, AAD is built-in for user authentication.</p>
<p>There are numerous other reasons why Power BI is still the most popular tool for BI and data visualisation. Its regular updates, resources, and simple yet effective query (natural language query engine) feature all work in its favour.</p>
