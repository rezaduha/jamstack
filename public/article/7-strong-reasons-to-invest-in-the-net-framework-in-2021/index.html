  <div class="article__content"><p>You may have a great web application idea in mind to solve the pain points of your target audience. However, when it comes to executing that idea, it’s considered wise to bank upon software architects, tech consultants, or seasoned developers. The reason being is they are not only well-versed with the popular tools, technologies, and frameworks that can bring your idea to life in a quick turnaround time but also know the strengths and weaknesses for each viable option available in the market.</p>
<p>Having said that, hiring a tech consultant requires shelling out a decent amount of money and if you are a startup or an SME, you may refrain from seeking end-to-end consultation before the project begins. Right? To help you overcome this dilemma, why not listen to seasoned technocrats who strongly recommend choosing the .NET framework for software and web application development. Before you hire dot net programmers or opt for dot net development services from a trusted company for a custom app development project, you must know the reasons why you should invest in this robust framework in 2021. Let’s dig deeper into the reasons.</p>
<h2 id="1-backed-by-microsoft">1. Backed by Microsoft</h2>
<p>The thing that makes the .NET framework stand out in the market is that it is developed and supported by the tech giant Microsoft. Having an industry titan behind a framework gives you a competitive advantage in the dynamic market landscape. Also, it gives you an assurance that all the good ideas that originate in the developer’s community like GitHub, Stack Overflow, etc. will soon be available to the framework. In a nutshell, when you opt for the .NET framework over others, you’ll get the most flexible, advanced, and robust framework well-maintained by Microsoft.</p>
<h2 id="2-easy-integration-with-other-microsoft-applications">2. Easy integration with other Microsoft applications</h2>
<p>Developing a web application using the .NET framework makes the integration with other Microsoft products like emails, exchange servers, office applications easier. Also, it provides you the flexibility to retrieve data with a single login. Not to mention, it makes communication secure and easier across the application.</p>
<h2 id="3-strong-community">3. Strong community</h2>
<p>When a framework is embraced by hundreds of thousands of developers and enterprises both large and small in size, it clearly indicates that it comprises something really good to attract such a strong audience. .NET is backed by a strong community of experts to help you overcome the challenges regarding this framework. Whether you are a startup, SME, or a large enterprise, you can get started with .NET development really fast. Besides this, it also has a slew of online forums to resolve the queries of users, and those who are new to this framework can find a plethora of online resources to ace in this robust web application development framework.</p>
<h2 id="4-scalability">4. Scalability</h2>
<p>Another strong reason to invest in the .NET framework is that it offers unmatched flexibility for developing both small and large applications. By leveraging this framework, a .NET software development company can redesign software and applications of any size to meet the changing business requirements. This development framework offers a rich suite of extensions that businesses can leverage to improve the features and functionality of their software &amp; web applications and offer a delightful user experience resulting in more conversions and profits.</p>
<h2 id="5-unparalleled-performance">5. Unparalleled performance</h2>
<p>Every software or application developed using the .NET framework renders unparalleled performance. .NET framework runs on object-oriented programming that allows developers to reuse the code and get rid of writing the same code again thereby saving a lot of time and effort. This not only reduces the software development lifecycle but also makes the software application light. Having a light application offers a host of business benefits including ease to deploy, unmatched performance, quick testing, and much more.</p>
<h2 id="6-robust-security">6. Robust security</h2>
<p>Security is a big concern for businesses when it comes to exposing your software or web application on the internet. Today, when you search for security enhancement techniques, you&rsquo;ll be bombarded with scary terms like payload protection, JWT tokens, ephemeral keys, policy-based authorization, IP safelisting, claim-based authorization, resource-based authorization, etc. that are hard to understand for a layman and much harder to implement. However, if you invest in the .NET framework, you&rsquo;ll get advanced and intuitive security mechanisms for authorization, authentication, and data protection.</p>
<h2 id="7-rich-compatibility">7. Rich compatibility</h2>
<p>Want to one-up your competitors? If yes, you should always make sure that your application runs across all the devices without any hiccups. When you develop a web application using the .NET framework, you can easily target your audience that is distributed across all platforms since your application will run smoothly on all devices. The modularization and toll improvisation capabilities of the .NET framework make it compatible across a wide gamut of platforms and devices.</p>
<p><strong>Wrapping up</strong></p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;ve got enough reasons in this insightful piece to consider .NET over other frameworks and invest in it for your software and web application development in 2021.</p>
