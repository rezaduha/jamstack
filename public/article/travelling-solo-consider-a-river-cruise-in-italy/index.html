  <div class="article__content"><p>If you’re looking to discover the authentic heart of Europe away from the thronging crowds of the cities, why not consider a cruise along some of the continent’s historic waterways? With networks of canals crisscrossing through scenic countryside, picturesque towns and even cities, a river cruise in Italy is one of the best ways to experience a unique perspective of the country. This very relaxed mode of travel takes you away from the fast paced bustle of the cities and roads, but that’s what makes it so special. A hotel barge allows you to get under the skin of a country whilst still enjoying the luxuries of a hotel, plus there’s plenty to do along the way!</p>
<h2 id="what-to-expect">What to Expect</h2>
<p>A river cruise in Italy promises so many opportunities for relaxation and repose. As the boat moves gently from mooring to mooring, you can sit on deck sipping your favourite drink (made by your in-house barman!) or, if you prefer, you can stroll along the towpath and admire the surroundings. If you are someone who likes activities, there’s also plenty for you to do in that respect on a barge holiday. Each boat carries bikes, so you can cycle along the flat towpath beside the vessel for as long (or as little) as you like. Plus, with stops in villages and towns along the way, you’ll get a chance to shop, explore and visit local restaurants - although, it must be said that the onboard catering is just as good as any restaurant, and way better than many. Whether you’re dying to see the magical canals of Venice, rural Tuscany or fashionable Milan, there’s an Italian itinerary that will appeal to every traveller.</p>
<h2 id="just-as-much-fun-for-the-solo-travellers">Just as Much Fun for the Solo Travellers</h2>

<p>Speaking of which, while cruising tends to cater for couples, groups and families, solo travellers don’t have to miss out. The best companies offer excellent solo cruise holidays, which are just perfect for the independent traveller. A river cruise in Italy on your own not only means you really get to immerse yourself in the country’s beauty and history, but it’s a great way to meet like-minded people. You might even make a few life-long friends as many of the guests do.</p>
<p>Solo trips are made extra special with unique itineraries designed to bring the group together and create a sense of camaraderie. So, even if you’re new to travelling alone, you’ll feel part of the gang. You can expect a welcome with a glass of sparkling Prosecco, giving you a chance to break the ice and mingle with your fellow travellers. Whether you’re travelling through Venice or another part of Italy’s stunning waterways, you’ll be treated to special experiences at historic sites as well as enjoying the fun group dinners, created by your gourmet chef.</p>
<p>Exploring Europe on your own is a fantastic opportunity to discover new places that you’ve never thought you’d visit. But if you decide to book a river cruise in Italy, you’ll also have the chance to make lifelong friends. Either way, you’ll have a lot of fun and create unforgettable memories.</p>
